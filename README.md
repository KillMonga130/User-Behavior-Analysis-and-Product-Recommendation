# Recommendation System Project

## Overview

This project demonstrates the process of building a recommendation system using the SVD (Singular Value Decomposition) and KNN (K-Nearest Neighbors) algorithms from the Surprise library. The dataset used is a custom dataset with user interactions, items, and various features.

## Introduction

This project aims to:
1. Preprocess and analyze the provided dataset.
2. Train recommendation models using SVD and KNN algorithms.
3. Evaluate the models using metrics like RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) and MAE (Mean Absolute Error).
4. Visualize the results to understand the performance of the models.
5. Provide product recommendations for users.

## Requirements

The following libraries are required to run the project:

- pandas
- seaborn
- matplotlib
- surprise
- scikit-learn

## Future Work

There are several potential improvements and extensions to this project:

1. **Hyperparameter Tuning**:
    - Perform hyperparameter tuning using techniques such as Grid Search or Random Search to optimize the performance of the SVD and KNN models.

2. **Incorporate Additional Features**:
    - Integrate additional user and item features into the recommendation models to potentially improve accuracy.

3. **Experiment with Other Algorithms**:
    - Test other collaborative filtering algorithms like Matrix Factorization or advanced methods like Deep Learning-based approaches.

4. **Cold Start Problem**:
    - Develop strategies to address the cold start problem, where new users or items with no prior interactions have difficulty receiving accurate recommendations.

5. **User Interface**:
    - Create a user-friendly interface to allow users to interact with the recommendation system and receive personalized recommendations.

6. **Scalability**:
    - Optimize the system for scalability to handle larger datasets and real-time recommendations.

7. **Diversity and Serendipity**:
    - Implement methods to ensure that recommendations are diverse and serendipitous, enhancing the user experience.
