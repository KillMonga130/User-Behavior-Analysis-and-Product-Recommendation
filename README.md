# Recommendation System Project

## Overview

This project demonstrates the process of building a recommendation system using the SVD (Singular Value Decomposition) and KNN (K-Nearest Neighbors) algorithms from the Surprise library. The dataset used is a custom dataset with user interactions, items, and various features.

## Introduction

This project aims to:
1. Preprocess and analyze the provided dataset.
2. Train recommendation models using SVD and KNN algorithms.
3. Evaluate the models using metrics like RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) and MAE (Mean Absolute Error).
4. Visualize the results to understand the performance of the models.
5. Provide product recommendations for users.

## Requirements

The following libraries are required to run the project:

- pandas
- seaborn
- matplotlib
- surprise
- scikit-learn

You can install the required packages using the following command:

```bash
pip install pandas seaborn matplotlib scikit-learn scikit-surprise
